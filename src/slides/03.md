# COMING SOON! Integation

1. Mock as far away from the code as possible to gain more confidence
  - `CLIENT` -> `sendInvoice` -> `buildInvoice` -> `filterApproved` -> `groupByPO` -> `loadExpenses` -> `http.get` ->(mock here) `SERVER` (from [Please don't mock me, Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4))
2. Focus on "realness" for integration tests
3. To gain more confidence get furether away from the "blast radius" of the legacy code
