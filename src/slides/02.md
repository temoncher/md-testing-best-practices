# Unit

1. Don't expose private members only to test them. [Don't test implementation details, Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details)
2. Try to make as much pure functions as possible, they are a lot easier to test
3. Use mocks wisely, [Please don't mock me, Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4)
  - Don't mock parts of the subject under test
  - If you write unit tests with mocks mock everything or nothing
  - If it is hard to write tests it does not necessarily mean that testing is hard, probably you have problems with architecture
  - Instead of mocking 3rd-party libs, wrap them. If they are not vital to the projectd or maybe you expect to change into your own wrappers (for example fetch/axios)
4. Don't tangle logic with delegation, "Functions should either do or delegate but never both" [Please don't mock me, Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4)
  - Separate logic functions/classes from delegation ones
  - Write logic as pure functions and test only return values
  - Don't include logic/calculations into delegators and test number of calls and arguments
5. Don't extract components/functions before it is time to
  - Small React components are implementation details, that's why you should not test them, that's why it is better to "hide" them from global by placing them inside the same file they are used in.
6. Don't write code unless you have to
  - use utility libraries like [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash), [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda), [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts)
7. Mock as far away from the code as possible to gain more confidence
  - `CLIENT` -> `sendInvoice` -> `buildInvoice` -> `filterApproved` -> `groupByPO` -> `loadExpenses` -> `http.get` ->(mock here) `SERVER` (from [Please don't mock me, Justin Searls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4))
